# LIRI Bot App

## Overview
In this project I made a LIRI Bot App in Node. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Expected Outcomes
The LIRI Bot was designed to produce search results based on the following commands:

* node liri.js concert-this
* node liri.js spotify-this-song
* node liri.js movie-this
* node liri.js do-what-it-says

Each command produced different search results as listed below:

* node liri.js concert-this "artist/band name"
* Name of venue
* Venue location
* Date of the event in MM/DD/YYYY format

* node liri.js spotify-this-song "song/track name"
* Artist
* Song
* Spotify song preview url
* Album

* node liri.js movie-this "movie title"
* Title of the movie
* Year the movie came out
* IMDB Rating of the movie
* Country where the movie was produced
* Language of the movie
* Plot of the movie
* Actors in the movie
* Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie

* node liri.js do-what-it-says
* Print the spotify results for "I want it that way" stored in the random.txt file

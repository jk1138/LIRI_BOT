# LIRI Bot App

## Overview
In this project I made a LIRI Bot App in Node. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. In this particular LIRI app the user can discover concert venues for their favorite artist, find songs/artist information with a spotify link, and discover rating information about their favorite movies. 

### Built with

- [JavaScript] (https://www.javascript.com/) - The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web pageâ€™s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
- [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/)- Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript.

**1**   `concert-this` 
        
    node liri.js concert-this
        
This command takes the user search request for artist in the bandsintown api, and returns the next concert time and date for that artist, as well as location and city.In this project, I set the default artist search to "Ariana Grande".
